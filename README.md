# self-solitaire
The goal is to code a solitaire program that plays the solitaire itself with machine learning.

Basic setup for the solitaire game is made in solitaire.py and at the moment game logic needs to be done. Also ui for testing the game
should be done before starting the machine learning implementation.

Idea is to have all possible moves as an input to the neural network used and have the neural network choose the best move as an output.
